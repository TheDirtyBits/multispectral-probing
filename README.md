# multispectral-probing
Repository to analyze multispectral image data and extract useful information

### Environment Setup
* [Python 3.6 (minimum)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [PyCharm IDE (preferably)](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
* [Manifold Viewer](http://www.manifold.net/updates/download_viewer.shtml)

#### Python Packages
* GDAL python package
* OpenCV

The manifold viewer is to be used to easily view the .tif files.  
Create an environment in Anaconda and install GDAL in it.  
Follow the GDAL tutorial to understand the tutorial.py script.  
OpenCV will help in managing the UI of a simple application, designed to simplify our work.
All the multispectral files can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uvfBOG4HxillOsGAQOJCioEOG5SRAQir?usp=sharing).
